This blog post will teach you how to create a ggplot using an open-source dataset called "penguins"

Instal package

```{r}
library(palmerpenguins)
library(highcharter)
library(ggplot2)
```

Let's take a brief at the dataset using the head function
```{r}
head(penguins)
```

Now we can create the scatter
```{r}
na.omit(penguins) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(bill_length_mm, bill_depth_mm, color = species))+
  geom_point()
```
